The ShoeSoleSense is a novel wearable device located in a shoe sole that contains both sensors and actuators. A combination of sensors (i.e. pressure, accelerometer) track the user's movements, and haptic and audio actuators help heighten the sense of virtual reality (e.g. the authors discuss how haptic feedback and the ``audio feedback of squashed snow'' help enhance the experience of being in a snowy setting). This prototype was developed primarily for CAVE-based user-training exercises where free use of hands is optimal, though it could conceivably be adapted to suit a wide range of AR situations.},

De Jesus Oliveira and Maciel present their initial research towards building a hand-mounted array of haptic actuators intended to help the wearer perform a variety of tasks including orientation. They propose that the actuators could be connected to environment-aware sensors so that the actuators would vibrate in a set pattern to alert the wearer of an obstacle (or help instruct them to perform a certain task). They contend that a haptic system could help visually impaired users to navigate. I would add that the project would also allow fully sighted users to perform certain tasks without needing to be distracted by personal technologies (i.e. using a smartphone to check a map). The authors also mention that the project could be used in order to navigate virtual space as well, though this potential is not explored further.},

In this article, researchers reveal the results of studies completed in the United States and South Korea on the social acceptability of interacting with on-body controllers. Participants watched videos of two people talking in an elevator in which one of the actors (the man or the woman) interacted with a device somewhere on their body. Participants then ranked factors such as ``awkwardness'' and ``coolness'' of the exhibited interaction as each actor performed it. This article is helpful for providing insight on social acceptability of wearable positioning as it relates to gender and culture.},

This article offers an evaluation of different physiological sensor inputs to augment video games based on user experience testing. The authors divide input into direct (e.g. gaze, temperature, respiration and EMG) and indirect (e.g. GSR and EKG) input types. Among other things, they found that users preferred direct control type, and that indirect sensors were best used to influence variables in the game world while direct sensors were most effective for directly controlling a character's action.},

MacLean discusses the potential benefits of haptic feedback as an ambient notification system. Unlike visual information, which can be obtrusive while completing a task, or sound, which can be obnoxious in a public environment, haptic feedback is, for the most part, experienced only by the user and does not directly interfere with the task at hand. The article contains many references to ambient haptic systems, both within the field of wearables and not, as well as a list of potential limitations to working for certain haptic systems.},

Our media landscape has undergone a seismic shift as digital technology has fostered the rise of "participatory culture," in which knowledge is originated, created, distributed, and evaluated in radically new ways. The Participatory Cultures Handbook is an indispensable, interdisciplinary guide to this rapidly changing terrain. With short, accessible essays from leading geographers, political scientists, communication theorists, game designers, activists, policy makers, physicists, and poets, this volume will introduce students to the concept of participatory culture, explain how researchers approach participatory culture studies, and provide original examples of participatory culture in action. Topics include crowdsourcing, crisis mapping, grid computing, digital activism in authoritarian countries, collaborative poetry, collective intelligence, participatory budgeting, and the relationship between video games and civic engagement."--Publisher's website.},

The intimate cover of the human body, i.e. garment is the interface, where many personal traits are embodied. With the improvements in textile and electronics industry, this embodiment can be carried on a higher level, where the garments become dynamic interfaces and extensions of the human body. This book consists of a research on skin, clothes and technology as extensions of human body, emotions, technology-mediated emotions and a design practice that explores the communicative level of wearable technology through turning it into a living surface, which can convert intangible data to tangible in order to provide an emotional communication. This book aims to show how Human-Technology interaction is carried into an alternative context, where technology dissolves in use and starts serving for enhancing {HHI.}},
