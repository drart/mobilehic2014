@inproceedings{williams2006exploring,
	Abstract = {JP:
This paper presents Damage, a smart bracelet used to alert the wearer to changes in a social network as well as to send and receive simple messages to other users. The interface consists of six LEDs connected to five snaps. The first LED (not attached to a snap closure) pulses white light if there is a message waiting for the user on the social network, while the other lights are linked to other members of the social network. Users can send each other messages in the form of lighting red, green or blue LEDs by opening or closing the snap. Some interesting points about this project include the concept that users can assign meaning to particular patterns of LEDs as opposed to a system where the meanings of patterns are predetermined. As the authors point out (5), this adds a layer of intimacy to the product such that only members of the group are aware of the meanings of the messages, and strangers may assume that the LEDs are decorative. With regards to form-factor, younger participants reviewing a sketch of the design were concerned that the flashing LEDs might be inappropriate for school (5) and would prefer something resembling a watch. The design was developed based on the observation that participants reviewing the researchers' earlier social network project found the vibration-based alerts frustrating when they came at inopportune times, despite the fact that they enjoyed being always connected to the social network (5).},

This project presents a prototype of a business suit with multiple minimally intrusive outputs for alerting to the user to notifications from their PDA. The suit consists of a watch-like display, a set of three coloured LEDs sewn into the cuff (with each LED corresponding to a different state of urgency), a vibrating motor located in the shoulder, and a PDA located in the pocket (which provides sound feedback and can be removed for more detailed information). },

This paper documents a study on whether haptic feedback influences perceived social presence, perceived virtual presence, perceived task completion efficacy, and/or task completion efficacy (measured by time it takes to perform a task). In the study, users performed a set of tasks with the PHANToM device: an interface used for remotely performing surgery. Perceived virtual presence, perceived task completion efficacy and task completion efficacy were all highest when a combination of haptic, audio and visual feedback was used as compared to just audio and visual feedback.  },

@inproceedings{kaye2005communicating,
	Abstract = {JP:
This paper argues than even extremely minimal interfaces can be effective tools for sending and receiving rich information. The participants in this project included couples in long-distance relationships. The interface consisted of a small dot located on the user's dashboard. When the user clicked the dot, his or his partner's dot would turn red, and then fade over time. If the user hovers his mouse over the dot, it reveals the current state of his partner's interface (i.e. the colour of the dot). Though this project focuses specifically on social interaction between couples, the finding that people find even a simple form of communication emotional and useful is relevant to the creation of other types of minimalistic interfaces.},

The iBand is a simple wrist-worn device that users may use to exchange contact information. Users enter their contact information and design a simple icon to represent them (which can be displated on a 5 by 5 LED display). When users shake hands, the bands exchange contact information through simple IR technology.  When not in use, the band display cycles through collected users' icons. The study highlights the fact that in different studies participants had different responses to the iBand possibly due to cultural differences (3). Users largely enjoyed the visual component of the project, with at least one participant remarking that they enjoyed identifying their own icon on the cycling displays (3). One user stated that they preferred the iBand to the same functionality incorporated into a smart watch, as an iBand is more easily recognizable to other users. However, this preference may be limited to social devices.},

	Abstract = {JP:
Though this project is much older than many of the others discussed here, it presents highly important information about the use of purely haptic systems for sending information. The HandJive is a handheld device that users can use to send haptic data to others and play games. Some notable findings include that: users were able to replicate increasingly difficult patterns as part of gameplay and enjoyed improvising their own routines (62), however, not all users found the device fun, researchers found it difficult to provide in-game rewards to expert users, and play had to be structurally determined rather than free-form (63).},

The ShoeSoleSense is a novel wearable device located in a shoe sole that contains both sensors and actuators. A combination of sensors (i.e. pressure, accelerometer) track the user's movements, and haptic and audio actuators help heighten the sense of virtual reality (e.g. the authors discuss how haptic feedback and the ``audio feedback of squashed snow'' help enhance the experience of being in a snowy setting). This prototype was developed primarily for CAVE-based user-training exercises where free use of hands is optimal, though it could conceivably be adapted to suit a wide range of AR situations.},

De Jesus Oliveira and Maciel present their initial research towards building a hand-mounted array of haptic actuators intended to help the wearer perform a variety of tasks including orientation. They propose that the actuators could be connected to environment-aware sensors so that the actuators would vibrate in a set pattern to alert the wearer of an obstacle (or help instruct them to perform a certain task). They contend that a haptic system could help visually impaired users to navigate. I would add that the project would also allow fully sighted users to perform certain tasks without needing to be distracted by personal technologies (i.e. using a smartphone to check a map). The authors also mention that the project could be used in order to navigate virtual space as well, though this potential is not explored further.},

In this article, researchers reveal the results of studies completed in the United States and South Korea on the social acceptability of interacting with on-body controllers. Participants watched videos of two people talking in an elevator in which one of the actors (the man or the woman) interacted with a device somewhere on their body. Participants then ranked factors such as ``awkwardness'' and ``coolness'' of the exhibited interaction as each actor performed it. This article is helpful for providing insight on social acceptability of wearable positioning as it relates to gender and culture.},

MacLean discusses the potential benefits of haptic feedback as an ambient notification system. Unlike visual information, which can be obtrusive while completing a task, or sound, which can be obnoxious in a public environment, haptic feedback is, for the most part, experienced only by the user and does not directly interfere with the task at hand. The article contains many references to ambient haptic systems, both within the field of wearables and not, as well as a list of potential limitations to working for certain haptic systems.},

The Participatory Cultures Handbook is an indispensable, interdisciplinary guide to this rapidly changing terrain. With short, accessible essays from leading geographers, political scientists, communication theorists, game designers, activists, policy makers, physicists, and poets, this volume will introduce students to the concept of participatory culture, explain how researchers approach participatory culture studies, and provide original examples of participatory culture in action. Topics include crowdsourcing, crisis mapping, grid computing, digital activism in authoritarian countries, collaborative poetry, collective intelligence, participatory budgeting, and the relationship between video games and civic engagement."--Publisher's website.},

The intimate cover of the human body, i.e. garment is the interface, where many personal traits are embodied. With the improvements in textile and electronics industry, this embodiment can be carried on a higher level, where the garments become dynamic interfaces and extensions of the human body. This book consists of a research on skin, clothes and technology as extensions of human body, emotions, technology-mediated emotions and a design practice that explores the communicative level of wearable technology through turning it into a living surface, which can convert intangible data to tangible in order to provide an emotional communication. This book aims to show how Human-Technology interaction is carried into an alternative context, where technology dissolves in use and starts serving for enhancing {HHI.}},
